## How to play

Battleship is a game based on the old classic pad-and-pencil game. This version is an app where you play against the computer. The ships are generated randomly and are hidden from both parties. The player and the computer takes turns to guess where the ship is and tries too sink it. The winner is the one who sinks the ship first.
